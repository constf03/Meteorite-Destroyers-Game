# Meteorite Destroyers Documentation


## Introduction

This is a simple 2D game that I developed as a project for a full stack programming course in 2023. In this game you play as a flying ship that shoots missiles while avoiding falling meteorites. The objective is to destroy them and score as many points as possible. The player has 5 lives, once they run out the game ends and if the player reached a personal record high score it is saved to a database.

Technologies used: JavaScript, Phaser, Node.js, Rest API, MongoDB
